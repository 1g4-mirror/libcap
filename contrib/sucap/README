This directory contains a port of the SimplePAMApp su to more
aggressively use libcap. The point of doing this is to better test the
full libcap implementation, and to also provide a use case for testing
PAM interaction with libcap and pam_cap.so.

The original sources were found here:

https://kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/pre/applications/SimplePAMApps-0.60.tar.gz

The SimplePAMApps contain the same License as libcap (they were
originally started by the same author!). The credited Authors in the
above tarball were:

  Andrew [G.] Morgan
  Andrey V. Savochkin
  Alexei V. Galatenko

The code in this present directory is freely adapted from the above
tar ball and is thus a derived work from that.

(Andrew would like to apologize to Andrey for removing all of the
config support he worked to add all those decades ago... I just wanted
to make a quick tester for a potential workaround for this pam_cap
issue: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212945 .)
